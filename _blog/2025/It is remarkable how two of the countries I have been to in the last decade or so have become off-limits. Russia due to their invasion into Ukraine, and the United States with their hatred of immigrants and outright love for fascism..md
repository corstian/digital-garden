It is remarkable how two of the countries I have been to in the last decade or so have become off-limits. Russia due to their invasion into Ukraine, and the United States with their hatred of immigrants and outright love for fascism.

It should be noted that although on paper these two are adversaries, they do not differ all that much from one another. In order to have money for nice things - such as beautiful metro stations or yachts - one starves their population to death, while the other feeds them to death. Different strategy; yet a remarkably similar result.
