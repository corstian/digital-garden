Design for dismersion
===============

Reorganizing the computer monitors on my desk I discovered something remarkable happens as the distance to these displays increases. Rather than putting them on the small extension of my corner desk I put them in the corner itself. What previously was like 50cm must now have become a little over a meter.

Not only the distance to these screens increased, but there was also a whole lot of desk in between myself and these monitors. Precious desk space to put papers, notes, books and perhaps yet another laptop. As the space between me and my computer increased, the importance of the thing decreased. No longer was it my whole world during workdays, but it had been downgraded to be merely a tool again. No longer capable of capturing my whole worldview, but instead just being a little part of it tucked away in a corner.

Over the course of decades computers have imposed themselves upon us, and our daily routine. It's the device which can do everything. Process information, get the news, communicate with friends and coworkers, manage a calendar and a hundred thousand things more. In that sense it is only logical that a computer catches and captures ones attention, but it makes the world dull, bland even. As I mentioned to a friend recently; "the resolution of the real world is just way better than those of my screens". I do not want my attention, my whole perception even, to be captured by computers. It is a disservice to life itself.


Most of the digital world however had been designed for immersion. To capture attention. To pull you in. To increase metrics. To ensure you spend more time in whatever walled garden you had been captured into. To sell more ads. To show you more ads. After all you are the product. It's not like there's only few of those. In this attention economy each and every company tries its best to capture a slice of your attention, which is the most valuable thing they are able to get out of you. Each digital experience is designed to perfection. It's smooth. It's seamless. It's easy, convenient and before you know it's 3AM as well.

And so I want to propose a different strategy here. One which treats users and their attention span with the respect they deserve. Not pulling you in, but pushing you away. Hostile user experience to an extent; smooth enough to get the task done, jagged enough not to let you linger around.

## Jagged design
So what would this jagged design system look like? Being a fan of brutalist architecture I love the style for its blunt honesty. For its tendency to push you away, but also for its embrace when weather is shit outside.

Some of the principles:
- Design elements as big as possible
- Visually signalling a healthy dose of apathy for users
- Simplicity; do not have a
