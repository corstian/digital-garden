Analytics in a JS-less world
==================

This post relates to my recent explorations on the development of progressively enhanced frontends, with a focus on the usability of web-applications without javascript. It is in the context of user-tracking and ad-delivery that the absence of javascript really uncovers what it is primarily being used for.

A primary use-case for javascript in todays world is the inclusion of user-tracking in client-applications. While client-side user tracking is no longer possible with javascript disabled, one can still track users from the backends of their applications. After all all interactions with the applications eventually hit the server. This provides the opportunity for remarkably powerful telemetry and usage insights. 

The JS-less world is less than ideal for adtech. Limiting yourself to work without it limits one to the extent data can be collected about individual users. And while this is the case, there are still remarkably powerful tracking mechanisms for collecting usage information in a JS-less world. Personally I would compare it with the telemetry coming from the JWST. While there is no camera providing a visual feed of the state of the satelite, there is a plethora of sensors providing a rather accurate and complete overview over the state of the device. It is much the same way for a HTML-only frontend. While you cannot track individual users, you can still see how they are using your application by tracking what operations they execute. Combine this with an event-sourced domain and the collection of wide-events, and you'll have telemetry and usage information on your application most analytics providers would be jealous of.
