Analytics and telemetry in context of the GDPR
====

Both telemetry and analytics are important for assessing the functioning and usage of an application. The GDPR provides regulations governing what information may be collected for this purpose, and how it should be processed.

The regulatory text can be found [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).

This post acts mostly as a high-level reference. For details; refer to the regulatory text.

## Principles
The processing of personal data ought to be based on the three principles of "lawfulness, fairness and transparency".

Data should only be collected and processes for explicitly specified legitimate[^1] purposes, and no further. Exemptions are made for archiving in the interest of public, scientific, historical or statistical purposes (See [Article 89](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-89-gdpr/)).
