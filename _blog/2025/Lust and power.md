Lust and power
===========

The human experiences of lust and power are two to be particularly careful about, according to mystical traditions. Genesis describes how the lust for absolute power led the angels to revolt against God, taking humanity along with their fall from grace. Later in the book it is described how angels came down from the heavens to be with the women of the earth. The apocryphal book of Enoch goes deeper in on what would have happened.
