IPv6 is your friend for small scale continuous deployments
========================================

In the pursuit of software quality, your CI/CD pipeline is one of the defining aspects on your success in continuously delivering working software. Nowadays much of this complexity is abstracted away behind build and deployment tools, though more often than not these involve more complexity than necessary.
