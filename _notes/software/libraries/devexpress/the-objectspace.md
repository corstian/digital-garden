# Regarding the `ObjectSpace`
There's not much to write about the `ObjectSpace` as it is widely (ab)used throughout XAF, aside from the point that the widespread availability of this object seems to be the number one way people like to amputate their own feet.

The point is this; while it is incredibly convenient to be able to access data at any point in time, this powerful ability requires the disciplined use of said ability by its user-developers. In absence of its disciplined use the result will be the wide and unchecked spread of access and modification logic for data objects. This inevitably leads to (severe) quality issues down the line.
