SoCraTes 2025, Soltau
====

This is a reflection of SoCraTes in Soltau this year. Lets start with some of the phrases which made my conference this year:

- "Not my circus. Not my monkeys.": *as referring to the constant grind*
- "Human ingenuity is primarily found in agriculture and war; one is about growing your own food, and the other one is about taking someone elses food"
- "People do not like to be told what to do. Instead they much rather talk about what they do instead."
- "The difference between a blink and a wink is deliberate practice"

For me, this years conference had been a quest for meaning within the software industry. It seems like all beautiful things in the IT industry are either created to accumulate power and influence for others, or to act as weapons. In the margins of the conference Romeu soberingly asked whether this would be different in any other industry. Lunch called, and no answer had been given.

In stark contrast to last year, this year I came there with a mission. While last year I got introduced to fancy topics like property-based testing, got a decent introduction to test-driven-development, and participated in a number of code-katas, this year focus revolved around meaning. What does it mean to write software (software craft), how do we communicate (misunderstanding better), and what are we doing it all for (empowering people through IT). While I did not expect a single conference to resolve the existential crisis I harbor about the software industry, this conference re-aligned my bearings, and gave me hope about the undercurrents in this industry. Throughout the conference there seemed to be a whole track about anti-capitalist, anti-patriarchal software development, where focus was not software, but instead on the impact it had on the real world. About how it interacts with systems and enforces these. But also about how we can imagine better ones, and build these next to what we currently have. One thought provoking remark had been shared that we cannot change existing systems by participating in them, but that we should build out new systems in parallel. Not destroy the existing systems, just show the way to something more humane. The conversations here had been refreshing, and I want to thank everyone in those sessions especially for bringing in their perspectives.

On a more personal level these sessions had helped me crystalize a vision on more humane software, and what that means. One which is against capturing users attention. One which is against exploitation. One which is against hoarding power, and creating walled gardens. It is at this point in time I am still railing against all the aspects which I
