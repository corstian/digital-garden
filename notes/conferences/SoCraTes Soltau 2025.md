SoCraTes Soltau 2025
====

This is a reflection of SoCraTes in Soltau this year. Lets start with some of the phrases which made my conference this year:

- "Not my circus. Not my monkeys.": *referring to the constant grind*
- "Human ingenuity is primarily found in agriculture and war; one is about growing your own food, and the other one is about taking someone elses food"
- "People do not like to be told what to do. Instead they much rather talk about what they do instead."
- "The difference between a blink and a wink is deliberateness"
