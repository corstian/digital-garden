> [Degani, Asaf. “ON THE TYPOGRAPHY OF FLIGHT DECK DOCUMENTATION,” December 1992, 40.](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19930010781/downloads/19930010781.pdf)

The brilliant thing about this paper is that it provides timeless guidelines for the legibility of text under various conditions. This paper had been written with the cockpit in mind, which is a place where the margin for error is small, and even details like the legibility of written or printed text matters.

The guidelines as presented in this paper are not exclusively applicable to the flight deck, and thus if you're designing interfaces for situations where the margin for error is small, or if you simply care for accessibility this is a truly fascinating read!
