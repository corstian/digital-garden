# Recurring topics
There are a number of topics keeping me occupied over longer timelines (2+ years). This page outlines some of these topics and what had come of them:

## Simplification of software development processes
From my perspective most software development processes and techniques are overly complex. It guided me onto a journey to see what could be done to simplify software, and how to quickly deliver high-quality apps.

## Reverse engineering, validation and verification of hardware components
Having mysteriously received a USB drive in the mailbox I set out on a journey discovering what this had been about. This led me deeper and deeper into the hardware intricacies of USB flash drives, eventually breaking open the hardware, going into logic analysis, attempting to extract working microcontrollers from these devices.

## Distributed database systems
Running into the limitations of existing databases over and over again I keep looking for a low cost high performance solution to data storage. My goal here is to build a data storage system which:

- Decouples computation from storage
- Elastically scales for storage sizes as well as computational workloads
- Is relatively cheap to run for the given performance / storage capacity
