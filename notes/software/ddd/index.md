Domain Driven Design is a methodology based on [the similarly named book by Eric Evans](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design) outlying an effective strategy to manage complexity in a software project. While the book covers technical concepts to do so, most of the book goes into the social dimensions of software maintenance and effective collaboration.
