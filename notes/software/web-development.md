# Disclaimer
Over the years I worked a lot with client-side frameworks. While at first these looked enticing for the control and responsiveness they provided, I consider them largely obsolete by now. Complex (_complex to the extent you have to build your own rendering pipeline_) applications can be built using webassembly, while all other web applications are better served through progressive enhancement. There is a place for client-side interactivity, but for performance, quality and accessibility reasons this should not be where you start a new project.
