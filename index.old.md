# Welcome

This place is a collection of various bits and pieces I find worthy to be shared with the larger WWW. It's a fairly broad collection at the same time, consisting of great music, interesting papers, posts and notes of my own, and more elaborate projects I am or have been working on.

To invite myself to keep this up to date I'm intentionally keeping things as simple as possible. Some effort has been invested to improve the legibility of code samples, mathematical equations and images, but other than that there's little point in polishing things up from a visual perspective. The web is confusing and slow enough as it is.

## Contents
There's many topics I find interesting enough to dive into, and I want this project to reflect the vast diversity of these interests. Some of these different topics somehow relate to one another, while others stand on their own.

Some entry points:

- [Software Development](/notes/software)
- [Projects of mine](/notes/projects)
- [Inspirational papers and other resources](/notes/papers/)

## Projects

- [Skyhop](/notes/projects/skyhop)
